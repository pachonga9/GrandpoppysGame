# checkersProject
 An ongoing project to build a checkers game from the ground up.

 Ultimate goals:
    1. Design a responsive and attractive layout.
    2. Use javascript to program a functional game.
    3. Implement the use of nodejs to make the game playable online.
    4. Eventual upgrade to chess game.
    5. Take over the world.

    Log 1: So far I have made a relatively okayish looking game board. Positioning and responsive
    layout is still finicky. I will keep messing with that, afterwards I can begin to design individual
    checker pieces. I am excited to get to the programming part but first thing's first.

    Log 2: Made the gameboard a little pretier. Fixed some minor design issues. Still need to implement responsive design. 
    Game pieces exist now. I may start experimenting with javascript for it and make it better looking after.

    Log 3: Switched id tags to class tags to avoid multiple uses of the same name. This caused errors in the HTML and will allow for easier identification within the javascript program. Identified each checker numerically using id tags.
